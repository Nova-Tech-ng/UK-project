## Documenting Model Integration for Flask and Django

### General Documentation

**Model Description:**
* A decision tree model predicting student grades (categorical: Pass/Fail) based on various features such as age, past grades, standardized test scores, class size, attendance, and study time.
* Model is saved as a pickled file named `decision_tree_model.pkl`.
* Input: A dictionary containing the features: 'Age', 'Past Grades', 'Standardized Test Scores', 'Class Size', 'Attendance', and 'Study Time'.
* Output:
  * A predicted grade as a string ('Pass' or 'Fail').
  * A probability distribution as a list of two floats: [probability of Fail, probability of Pass].

**Model Loading:**
```python
import pickle

def load_model(model_path):
  """Loads the pickled model from the specified path.

  Args:
    model_path: The path to the pickled model file.

  Returns:
    The loaded model object.
  """
  with open(model_path, 'rb') as f:
    model = pickle.load(f)
  return model
```

**Prediction Function:**
```python
import numpy as np

def predict_grade(model, data):
  """Predicts a student's grade using the given model and input data.

  Args:
    model: The trained model.
    data: A dictionary containing the student's features.

  Returns:
    A tuple containing the predicted grade as a string and the probability distribution as a list.
  """
  input_data = np.array([data['Age'], data['Past Grades'], ...])  # Replace with actual features
  # Add preprocessing steps if necessary
  probabilities = model.predict_proba(input_data.reshape(1, -1))[0]

  # Determine the predicted class based on a threshold
  threshold = 0.5  # Adjust threshold as needed
  predicted_class = "Pass" if probabilities[1] >= threshold else "Fail"

  return predicted_class, probabilities
```

### Framework-Specific Examples

#### Flask

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

# Load the model
model = load_model('decision_tree_model.pkl')

@app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])
def predict():
  data = request.json
  predicted_class, probabilities = predict_grade(model, data)
  return jsonify({'predicted_class': predicted_class,
                  'probability_distribution': probabilities.tolist()})
```

#### Django

```python
from django.http import JsonResponse
from django.views.decorators.csrf import csrf_exempt

def predict(request):
  if request.method == 'POST':
    data = json.loads(request.body)
    predicted_class, probabilities = predict_grade(model, data)
    return JsonResponse({'predicted_class': predicted_class,
                          'probability_distribution': probabilities.tolist()})
```

### Additional Considerations

* **Threshold Adjustment:** The threshold for determining the predicted class can be adjusted based on your specific requirements.
* **Error Handling:** Consider adding error handling for cases where the input data is invalid or the model fails to make a prediction.
* **Performance Optimization:** If performance is critical, explore ways to optimize the prediction process.

This documentation provides a clear and comprehensive explanation of the model, its inputs, outputs, and integration into Flask and Django applications, including the desired probability distribution format.
